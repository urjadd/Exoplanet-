# Exoplanet Analysis with SHAP

This project focuses on the analysis and interpretation of exoplanet data using various machine learning techniques, statistical analysis, and the SHAP library. The goal is to identify important features that influence the detection and characterization of exoplanets.

## Project Overview

Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. The detection and study of these planets help us understand planetary systems beyond our own. This project uses machine learning models to analyze exoplanet data and employs SHAP values to interpret the results.

## Methods Used

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loading and cleaning the exoplanet dataset.
   - Handling missing values and feature engineering.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
   - Identifying patterns and anomalies.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Conducting statistical tests to identify significant features.
   - Analyzing correlations between features and target variables.

4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Training and evaluating models using cross-validation techniques.
   
5. **Model Interpretation with SHAP**:
   - Calculating SHAP values to understand feature importance.
   - Visualizing SHAP values to interpret model predictions and gain insights.
